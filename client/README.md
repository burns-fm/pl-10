# PL-10 Front end code

If you want to be able to do anything like tweak the visualizer math or colour, adapt the player to allow other media types and so on, this is where you need to make those changes.

The front end for PL-10 is largely organized into a couple of primary classes, some helper functions and classes, and sets of constants.

Until this documentation is more complete, it's recommended that you only change those files if you know your way around TypeScript or at least don't mind blowing things up and having to start over. You can always do that.
